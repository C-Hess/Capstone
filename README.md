# 4 Ninjas Learn Grammar

This is an early prototype game to help educate computer science students on the concepts of programming languages. The main goal of the game is to diffuse the bomb before the time runs out. To diffuse the bomb, the player must analyze a DFA to determine the right order to cut the bomb wires. This process is nearly identical to the process of determining if a given string satisfies a grammar (DFA)

## Run instructions
To run the game, simply open the `unity/` folder in Unity and hit the play button, open the main menu scene found in the `assets/scenes` folder and hit the **play** button. Eventually, the project should eventually be built to support html5 webGL so that it can be played in the web browser
